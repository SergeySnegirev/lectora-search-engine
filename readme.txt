Features:
- compatible both with Lectora X and Lectora 11
- full international support (Spanish, French, German etc.)
- works both in SCORM and HTML mode
- full cross-browser compatibility, including mobile devices
- easily exclude specific pages, sections or whole chapters (e.g. test section) from search
- easily exclude specific objects (e.g. exercise feedbacks) from search

Basic installation:
- drag the supplied Lectora Library Object (.awo) file to your title. Lectora will add a dropdown menu, a HTML object, a text input field and a button, all appropriately named "SearchEngine...something" to your title.
- now drag the transparent button called 'SearchEngine button' anywhere you like. E.g. you can find a picture of a magnifying glass, add it to your title and put the button on top of it.
- now your users can click that button to bring up search dialog, enter search phrase and see a list of all pages that contain that phrase (along with snippets for extra comfortable navigation)
- keep in mind that you have to upload your title online (to LMS or any web hosting) for the search to work, otherwise it will be limited to current page only (e.g. in Browser Preview when you hit F9 or when viewing the title from your local drive)

How to exclude pages:
Lectora 11:
- select the Table of Contents object called "Search Engine - TOC"
- click Properties tab
- click Included Pages button
- use checkboxes to select which pages, sections and chapters are searchable

Lectora 10:
- select the page or chapter you want to exclude
- click the General tab in the Properties
- uncheck the "Include in the Table of Contents" box

Please note that including a chapter or a section automatically makes its first page available to search engine, even if you uncheck all pages that it contains.

How to exclude specific objects:
Lectora 11:
- select the object or objects you want to exclude
- click Properties tab
- click small arrow in the Appearance tab
- type excluded-from-search (no quotes, two hyphens) and click OK

Lectora X:
Although Lectora X does not provide a convenient way to mark objects as excluded from search, you can convert any textbox to image to make it non-searchable. Here is how:
- select the textbox you want to convert to image
- open the General tab of Text Propeties
- check 'Render text as image'
